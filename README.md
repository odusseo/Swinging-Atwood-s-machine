# Swinging-Atwood's machine
Please consult the prettier English version, since the Italian one presents several errors and typos.

Study of the Swinging-Atwood-s-machine dynamics with Lagrangian mechanics. Numerical and graphical simulation of the chaotic system, computation of Lyapunov's exponent of the configuration for a thousand values of mass ratio. Project conceived in the context of *PAF* extracurricular course held by prof. Franco Dalfovo at the University of Trento, a.y. 2017/2018.
